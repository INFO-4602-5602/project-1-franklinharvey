The two resources I used were the tutorial and this: https://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/402dd382a51a4f6eea487f9a35566de0

I did everything via a python server, which I included in `localServer.sh`

## Bells & Whistles

I only did one bell: `Bell: Styling your Visualization`. I made a color palette at http://paletton.com/#uid=73x0I0kwi++bu++hX++++rd++kX. They are just nice shiny complimentary colors.
